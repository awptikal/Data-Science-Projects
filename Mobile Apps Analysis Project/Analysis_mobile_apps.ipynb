    "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n",

    "\n",
    "<h2> Goal of analysis </h2>\n",
    "<p>The goal of our analysis is to deduce what is the driving force behind the success of free mobile apps for both mobile markets and how we can replicate their success. So, in order to measure the idea of success, we can use the number installs of each app in order to quantify ones success and if that is not available then we will use the user rating for each app. Here, we will use some old school methods to perform our analysis to mix it up abit and this will be done by omitting the use of packages such as pandas and matplotlib and relying on textual output.</p>\n",

    "<h2>Conclusion of Analysis</h2>\n",
    "<p>From our Android apps dataset, we saw that there was clear linearity between the number of reviews left on the app and the number of installs. Despite knowing this implicity we showed that this was infact the case based on our analysis. Also, the most installed/downloaded Android apps were found out to have content rating for every demographic and these apps mostly fell under the 'Business' or 'Tools' genres. We may assume that most of these installs maybe be from the older generations due to these genres are mostly what adults are more likely to download and install.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>For our IOS dataset, we stated that the measurement of success was based on the user rating for each app in the App Store. By using this metric we compared this against the content rating and genre to see if there is any trends/relationships present. From here, we found that the content rating for all successful IOS apps was '4+' which also basically caters for all demographics except maybe for all under 4 years old, but this maybe just that you cannot select that content rating when you upload an app to the App Store. Also, the genres that these successful apps reside in are mostly under the 'Games' and 'Entertainment' categories which is the exact opposite of the 'Business' and 'Tools' successful genres seen in the Google Play store.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Final Takeaway</h2>\n",
    "<p>Thus, we venture back to the original motivation for this analysis which was we wanted to find the driving force behind the success of these free mobile apps in both app stores and how we can use these ideas for our own apps. So, we can conclude that in order to be successful in both app markets is to cater for the wider audience, such as do not create apps that are limited to a certain age range in order to attract more users. For the Google Play store specifically, we should try to make apps in the 'Business' and 'Tools' category as these are the apps that attract the most downloads and installs. And for the App store, we should try to strive for apps that are either under 'Games' or 'Entertainment' apps if we want to produce a more successful app.</p>"
